# Amazon warehouse simulator

This project was made for a homework assignment in my second year of HBO-ICT. The assignment was inspired by the drones used in the Amazon warehouses.The aim was to build a 3D-recreating of the warehouse, where cargo was continuesly delivered and sent and drones were used to store the received cargo.

The core logic was written in C#.The robots use Dijkstra's algorithme for pathfinding. Three.JS was used for the visualisation.Since graphics were not a factor in the final grade, we focussed on creating a simple aesthetic using a a handfull of simple models created in Autodesk Maya.
